# NYC-MLProject

This repository was used by Shira Weiss and Dor Bachar while working on their project in ML, as part of their Bachelor's Degree in C.S.

The project's purpose is to try and build a model that will predict prices for apartments in New-York, based on data from the apartments'
environment, rather than data on the apartments itself. 

The project here on git is missing the data itself, since it was too big to upload, so only the code is included here.
